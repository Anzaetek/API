# QML examples

We show here how to perform ML on the same data with a classical algorithm (XGBoost) and a QML algorithm (QRF, cf. arxiv 2210.02355) using our APIs.
The data is derived from a public dataset on cancer research.
In this version, the QML performance varies with runs and it is generally expected to be best exploited by building an ensemble model on top of classical + QML.
