Welcome to the Anzaetek API reference repository.  This repository contains examples for working with the Anzaetek API.  

# API Overview
The Anzaetek API is a RESTful API that provides access to the Anzaetek service.  The API provides access to the following resources:
- **Derivatives**: provides quantum computing approaches to financial derivatives pricing
- **Machine Learning**: provides quantum computing approaches to various machine learning problems
- **optimization**: provides quantum computing approaches to optimization problems
- **quantum_chemistry**: provides quantum computing approaches to quantum chemistry problems
- **quantum_hardware**: providesa an API for direct access to quantum hardware

# API Documentation
