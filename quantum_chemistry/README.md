# Quantum Chemistry Examples
These example show non-covalent interaction modeling using (simulated) photonics QC.
More precisely, they use (Quantum) Drude Oscillators to model a 2 atom interaction.
Please cf. arxiv: 2306.08544 for details about the methodology.
On principle, this methodology can be scaled to much larger problems and is of interest 
for compounds with complex long-distance/non-covalent interactions such as RNA and proteins.
