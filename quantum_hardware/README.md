# Quantum Hardware

These example show how to use our API to access a variety of backends & hardware.

# gate_based_non_photonics.py
In `gate_based_non_photonics`, we run the same QASM program with a variety of backends.

# photonics.py
In `photonics.py`, we show how to run a simple program on a discrete quantum photonics platfrom using our OpticQASM standard.

# qem.py
`qem.py` will show Quantum Error Mitigation (QEM) examples

# dsl.py
`dsl.py` shows how to use our DSL for specific quantum programs, here a QUBO optimizer.
