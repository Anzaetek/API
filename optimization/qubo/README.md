# QUBO problems

This folder shows examples of QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) optmizations.
We show both examples where the QUBO matrix is encoded from a contraints program (`optimizer_example_*.py`) as well as examples where the QUBO matrix is entered directly.

## QUBO with GROQ
In the folder `groq_qubo`, you will find portfolio optimization and re-optimization examples with a Groq/Maxeler backend. Please contact groq@anzaetek.com for details.
