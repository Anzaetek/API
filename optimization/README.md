## hybrid_optimization
In the `hybrid_optimization` folder, you will find examples that expand the problem sizes that can be tackled with actual quantum hardware thanks to the usage of hybrid methodologies

## hypersolver_examples
In the `hypersolver_examples` folder, you will find relatively detailed examples on how to use the HyperSolver related APIs

## knapsack_with_hypersolver
In the `knapsack_with_hypersolver` folder, you will find specific knapsack solver API usage examples

## qhrp
In the `qhrp` folder, you will find examples  

## qubo
In the `qubo` folder, you will find examples using our QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) solvers, either directly or via our constraint engine.
