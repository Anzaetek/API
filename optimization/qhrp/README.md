# QHRP

This folder shows examples of the Quantum Hierarchical Risk Parity (QHRP)  method.
The method consists in finding an optimal permutation of the order of the assets to concentrate variance on the diagonal of the covariance matrix, and then allocates risks recursively.
The permutation searhc is encoded as a QUBO problem internally.
